Be a Defensive Driver! Take things slow.                                        Come to a complete stop before you scan QR codes!                               Make sure you're scanning a QR code every time you do something significant.    Make sure to check your district memos. This goes for new employees especially. For the sake of transparency: if you need to 10-21, why? Can OIC assist?        Try and at least do one report per night. Show you're working!                  Make sure you're timing your lunches and clocking in and out on time.           Clean out your vehicles when fueling! I don't want to clean your junk.
